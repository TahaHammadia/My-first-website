		<h1>The Covid-19 Political Game</h1>
		<p id='link'><a href="game.html" style="cursor: pointer">Game</a></p>
		<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', Arial, serif">Ruler, save your people <em>(or your power)</em> from Covid-19 !!</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Rules of the game</h2>
		<p>In this game, you are the ruler of an instable country. In order to maintain your power, you must keep your popularity high enough. At the beginning of the game,
		you are doing pretty well. Sadly for you, the Covid-19 pandemic hits your country. And as it is written in history books, great troubles bring with them political changes.
		In order to keep your position <em>(and your head)</em>, you must manage the coming period wisely during one year (52 weeks). Pay attention to two things :</p>
		<ul class="helpList">
			<li>keeping the pandemic under control (the people fears death and illness)</li>
			<li>avoiding imposing too strict laws (the people hates laws, even if it saves its life)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Seems complicated ? Just remember that if your popularity is less than 20 % for two weeks, your country will go into revolution. <br>For the first version, there is
		no saving of the session <em>(as long as I haven't learnt PHP and got a server)</em>.</p>
		<h2>Use stats</h2>
		<p>The game gives you a lot of stats in order to make good choices :</p>
		<ol class="helpList">
			<li>Week n: gives you the number of the week</li>
			<li>R0: tells you the value of the famous R0 parameter</li>
			<li>Week's cases: tells you how many people have been infected the last week</li>
			<li>Week's death: tells you how many people have died the last week</li>
			<li>Total cases: tells you the number of infections from the beginning of the game</li>
			<li>Total death: tells you the number of people who have died since the beginning of the game</li>
			<li>POPULARITY: THE MOST IMPORTANT VALUE, TELLS YOU HOW MUCH YOU ARE POPULAR</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Choose your actions</h2>
		<p>In this first version, the actions have two effects. The first one is to decrease the value of R.
		The second is to decrease popularity. The game offers you the possibility to choose your actions among 10 :</p>
		<ul class="helpList">
			<li>Publicity on Covid-19 : R decreases by 0.05 and the popularity decreases by 0.1% each week</li>
			<li>Public Speeches : R decreases by 0.1 and the popularity decreases by 0.3% each week</li>
			<li>Foreign travel restrictions : R decreases by 0.25 and the popularity decreases by 0.5% each week</li>
			<li>Curfex : R decreases by 0.55 and the popularity decreases by 1.1% each week</li>
			<li>Locking 1 : R decreases by 0.85 and the popularity decreases by 1.7% each week</li>
			<li>Locking 2 : R decreases by 1.1 and the popularity decreases by 2.3% each week</li>
			<li>Mandatory Mask : R decreases by 0.6 and the popularity decreases by 1.3% each week</li>
			<li>Internal travel restrictions : R decreases by 0.4 and the popularity decreases by 0.9% each week</li>
			<li>Quarantine centers : R decreases by 1.3 and the popularity decreases by 3% each week</li>
			<li>Kill the old sick : R decreases by 2.5 and the popularity decreases by 10% each week</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Moreover, there are other special variations of popularity :</p>
		<ul class="helpList">
			<li>If the number of the week's cases is greater than 10 000, the popularity decreases by 5%</li>
			<li>If the number of the deaths by Covid-19 in a week is greater than 500, the popularity decreases by 5%</li>
			<li>If R is less than 1.5, the popularity increases by 10%</li>
			<li>If the number of the deaths by Covid-19 in a week decreases to less than 50 after having been greater than 500, the popularity increases by 7.5%</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For this first version, the chosen values are more or less guesses. I hope that for the next versions the values will be more 
		representitive of the reality.</p>
